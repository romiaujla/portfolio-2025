      </h3>
      <p className="text-sm lg:text-base px-10 lg:px-0">
        I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 5+ years of experience building
        scalable, full-stack web applications. I specialize in TypeScript,
        Node.js, and modern frontend frameworks like React and Angular, with a
        focus on clean architecture, intuitive user interfaces, and distributed
        systems for web applications.

        My journey began as a Junior developer, where I quickly adapted to
        coding standards at Workd. Within a year, I advanced to a Mid-level
        Software Engineer, demonstrating my ability to work under pressure and
        build robust, user-friendly applications. As a Software Engineer Team
        Lead, I led 3-5 developers, collaborated closely with design and product
        teams, and mentored junior developers. My curiosity drove me to
        streamline deployments using Bitbucket API, reducing deployment times
        from 3-4 hours to under 30 minutes. I also championed front-end testing,
        ensuring stable releases and boosting customer satisfaction and trust in
        our product.

        Beyond code, I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through
        technology, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and continuously
        improving my skills. Whether leading projects or contributing as part of
        a team, I enjoy turning ideas into reliable, impactful products that
        make people's lives better.
